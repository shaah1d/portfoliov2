## What is Decentralized Raffle?

<br />


## Introduction

Decentralized Raffle is a blockchain-based lottery system built on Ethereum, designed to provide a transparent and provably fair experience for participants. By integrating **Chainlink VRF v2** for cryptographically secure random number generation and **Chainlink Automation** for automated execution, this project ensures trustless winner selection without manual intervention. Deployed using Foundry, the smart contract offers robust security features and a seamless user experience for entering raffles and claiming prizes.

## Features

1. **Provably Fair Randomness**: Utilizes Chainlink VRF v2 to generate cryptographically secure random numbers, ensuring unbiased winner selection with on-chain verifiable proof.
2. **Automated Execution**: Chainlink Automation triggers raffle completion based on time intervals, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
3. **Transparent Prize Pool**: All entrance fees are collected in the contract, and the entire balance is awarded to the winner.
4. **Secure State Management**:
   - Two states: `OPEN` (accepting entries) and `CALCULATING` (processing winner).
   - Prevents entries during winner calculation for integrity.
5. **User-Friendly Interaction**:
   - Simple entry process with a fixed entrance fee.
   - Events emitted for raffle entry and winner selection for easy tracking.
6. **Robust Security**:
   - Reentrancy protection through state updates before external calls.
   - Custom error handling for clear failure reporting.
   - Gas-optimized design with immutable variables.
7. **Testing and Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite using Foundry, covering key functionalities like entry, upkeep, and winner selection.

#### User Workflow

1. Users connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the raffle frontend.
2. Users pay the entrance fee in ETH to enter the raffle via the `enterRaffle()` function.
3. Chainlink Automation monitors the contract and triggers `performUpkeep()` when the raffle interval elapses and conditions are met.
4. Chainlink VRF generates a random number, and the contract selects a winner via `fulfillRandomWords()`.
5. The prize pool is automatically transferred to the winnerâ€™s address.
6. Users can view the recent winner, raffle state, and participant list through the frontend.
7. The raffle resets automatically for the next round.


#### Tech Stack

- **Solidity ^0.8.18**: Smart contract development for Ethereum.
- **Foundry**: Development framework for testing, deployment, and coverage analysis.
- **Chainlink VRF v2**: Provides verifiable random number generation.
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automates raffle execution based on time triggers.
- **React & Tailwind CSS**: Frontend for user interaction (optional, as per previous response).
- **ethers.js**: JavaScript library for blockchain interaction.

## Open-Source and Transparent

Decentralized Raffle is an open-source project, fully transparent on the Ethereum blockchain. All transactions, random number generation, and winner selections are verifiable on-chain, ensuring trust and fairness. The project is freely accessible for developers to fork, audit, or extend.

## Get Involved

I welcome contributions to enhance the Decentralized Raffle ecosystem. Whether you're a blockchain developer, smart contract auditor, or UI/UX designer, you can contribute by:

- Improving test coverage (currently at 56.67% lines, as per `coverage.txt`).
- Adding new features like multi-winner raffles or dynamic entrance fees.
- Enhancing the frontend for better user experience.
