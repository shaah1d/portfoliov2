## Introduction

Skiper UI is a modern UI library for Next.js components that streamlines the development process. With over 25,000 user views in the last 30 days, it provides sleek, ready-to-use components that can be implemented with simple copy-paste functionality. Built on top of shadcn, Skiper UI offers a comprehensive collection of components that save development time while maintaining high-quality design standards.

## Why Skiper UI?

I was bored seeing every website look the same with shadcn. We needed a change! So I built one because I thought it was a cool thing to do.

The amazing response? I love the dev community so much - can't believe the amount of love it's received!
